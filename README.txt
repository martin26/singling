Singling 1.4.0 for 1.00 - 1.14d
By Jonathan Vasquez (fearedbliss)
Released on March 1, 2017
-----------------------------------

This is a light addon to improve the Single Player experience. The below
features are modifications that are accepted by the Diablo IncGamers Single
Player Forum (SPF).

Overall this serves as a consolidation of FAM (Forum Accepted Mods).

This bundle supports the following versions:
- 1.00 -> 1.06
- 1.07
- 1.08
- 1.09[a,b,d]
- 1.10[b,s,f]
- 1.11b
- 1.12a
- 1.13d
- 1.14d

1.00 - 1.14d
-------------------
- You can now run multiple clients of Diablo II.

1.07 - 1.12a
------------------
- You can now make hardcore characters without being softcore.

1.11b - 1.13d
-----------------
- Ladder Runewords are now unlocked and can be used on Single Player.
- Runes are now colored orange (Already included in 1.13d+)

Mini-Images
-----------
- The Diablo II Classic and Lord of Destruction Mini-Images are now included.

  These mini-images cannot be used to install Diablo II. You still need to purchase
  a copy of the game before you can install the game. However, what the
  mini-images allow you to do, is to play the game without the CD. Blizzard removed
  this restriction starting from version 1.12.

  Providing these mini-images, allows players that are interested in playing older
  versions of Diablo II (or to Time Travel) to be able to easily do that.

  You will need DAEMON Tools or another ISO application for this to work.
  * Note: Not all ISO apps work with these mini-images (WinCDEmu doesn't work).
