Singling 1.4.0 for 1.00 - 1.14d
By Jonathan Vasquez (fearedbliss)
Released on March 1, 2017
-----------------------------------

1.4.0
-------------------
- Includes Multi-Instance Game.exe for 1.14d
- 1.14d Runeword Mod works with the same file as 1.13d
- Removed some extra data/ folder files.
- If you want to revert to Vanilla, retrieve the files
  from the Bliss Complete Collection.

1.3.0
-------------------
- You can now run multiple instances of Diablo II for versions 1.00 to 1.06.
- The Diablo II Classic and Lord of Destruction Mini-Images are now included.

  These mini-images cannot be used to install Diablo II. You still need to purchase
  a copy of the game before you can install the game. However, what the
  mini-images allow you to do, is to play the game without the CD. Blizzard removed
  this restriction starting from version 1.12.

  Providing these mini-images, allows players that are interested in playing older
  versions of Diablo II (or to Time Travel) to be able to easily do that.

  You will need DAEMON Tools or another ISO application for this to work.

1.2.0
-------------------
- You can now make hardcore characters without having to beat softcore
  for every version below 1.13 (1.13 lifted the requirement).

1.1.0
-------------------
- Added support for 1.09a/b, 1.10b/s multiple instances. This kinda contradicts my
  previous commit of only "1" being supported, but it seems people play 1.10b
  for the +2 BKWB and then might move to 1.10f or another future patch.
  So I guess that I'll add support for any version that the community plays,
  even if it is in the same version number.
  
1.0.5
-------------------
- Removed 1.09b from Singling. Only one of each version will be supported (again). 1.09d has been chosen
since this patch has the most players in the SPF community.

1.0.4-r2
-------------------
- Removed the "Singling <Version>" from the Title Screens for 1.11-1.13

1.0.4-r1
-------------------
- Added limited support for versions 1.07, 1.08, 1.09b/d, and 1.10f by only including the modified D2gfx.dll.
  
1.0.4
-------------------
- Completely removed support for all versions before 1.11b.

1.0.3
-------------------
- Added support for the remaining patches expansion patches (Starting from 1.07 - One version of each patch was picked)
- Removed support for 1.09b (In accordance with the above - one version of each patch. This makes it easier for me to maintain as well)

1.0.2
-------------------
- Added 1.09b/d support. 1.09b/d now has colored runes and you can also open multiple copies of d2.

1.0.1
-------------------
- Experience.txt has been removed. Experience ratio is back to Vanilla. This mod is now equal to RWM + Modified dll all in one bundle.

1.0.0
-------------------
- Initial Release
