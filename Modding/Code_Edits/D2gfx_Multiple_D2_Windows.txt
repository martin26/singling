VERSION: 1.13d

CODE:

0000B6B0   74 45            JE SHORT 0000B6F7

WHAT TO DO:

Change from JE SHORT 0000B6F7 -> JMP SHORT 0000B6F7

HOW TO FIND THE OFFSET:

1. Open OllyDbg
2. File -> Open -> D2gfx.dll
   A window will open up saying "Request to load DLL", press "Yes".
   
3. Press F9 to Run (It will switch from ntdll to the D2gfx space
4. Right click the main thread window (The one with a C), Search for -> All referenced text strings
5. Find the string that says: ASCII "Only one copy of Diablo II may run at a time." and double click it
6. Scroll up a little bit until you find the first "JE SHORT", if you right click and click Analysis -> Analyse code, and then click the
   "JE SHORT", you will see a line that goes from the JE SHORT to the CMP DWORD PTR DS all the way on the bottom... 
   aka "If you only have one window open, then open the D2".
   
   Right now the value is JE which means "Jump if equal", we need to change it to "Jump no matter what". So we will change it from JE to JMP.
7. Double click the JE SHORT, and when the assemble window comes up, change it from JE to JMP. You will notice that the number on the left will change from
   74 to EB.
8. Once you change it, let's save the new dll. Right click the window -> Copy to executable -> All modifications
   You probably will get a window that says "Copy selection to executable file", press "Copy all"
   
   A new window will open up with a "D" at the top left. Right click the window and press "Save file" and save it. That's it. You now have a new Modified D2gfx.dll.
